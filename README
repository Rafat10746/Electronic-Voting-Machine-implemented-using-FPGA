Name of the project: Digital Voting Machine Using Verilog

The project aims to design and implement a secure digital voting system using Verilog HDL
(Hardware Description Language). This system will simulate a voting process where each voter
can securely cast their vote, ensuring data integrity, voter anonymity, and real-time vote
counting. By leveraging Verilog, the system can be synthesized into hardware components like
FPGAs (Field-Programmable Gate Arrays), making it efficient and reliable for real-world
applications.

Scope of the Project:
•Design and Simulation: The voting system will be designed using Verilog HDL and
simulated using software like quartus to verify functionality.
•Hardware Implementation: Once the design is verified, it will be implemented on an
FPGA board for practical testing.

System Overview:
1. Voter Registration Module: This module allows voters to input their unique voter ID to
ensure only authorized individuals can cast votes.
2. Voting Module: This allows the voter to select a candidate from a list and cast a vote.
Once cast, the vote is recorded, and the voter cannot vote again.
Vote Counting Module: This module counts votes in real-time and displays the results
after voting ends.
3. Result Display Module: This will display the number of votes for each candidate after
the voting process.

Hardware Components:
1. FPGA Board (e.g., Xilinx or Altera): The core platform where the Verilog code will be
synthesized and the voting system will be implemented.
2. Input Devices:
   o Keypad: For voters to enter their ID and cast their vote.
   o Push Buttons: To simulate vote submission.
   Display Devices:
   o LEDs or 7-Segment Display: To indicate the voting results.
   o LCD Display: For more detailed result output.
   Memory Unit (EEPROM or SRAM): To store voter IDs and votes securely.
   Clock Generator: To provide timing control for the system operations.
